raspiBilliards
This is an old project of mine.  You can play billiards with yourself without keeping score or having any rules.

There is collision detection with some hacks where I rewind the action to the point of impact in an attempt to avoid balls falling into each other or rotating around each other.

This project is written in openGLES 2.0 for the raspberry pi.  Some additional files that are needed can be found here:

They're listed in the Makefile.

src/glesTools.c has a functional obj loader.

This code is licensed under the GPL-3 license.

Good luck in your coding.  I hope this helps someone.
